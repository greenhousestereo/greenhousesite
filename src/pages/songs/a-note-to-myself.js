          Don’t even act like you never knew<br />
          Voice in the mirror it was nothing new<br />
          Everyone’s past comes back on you<br />
          And you gotta get high to find some room<br />
          You have to<br />
          You have to be<br />
          You have to be pure poetry<br /></p>

          <p>Don’t you know some things shouldn’t exist<br />
          Mosquitoes in the air, not a lick of difference<br />
          Always in the reach of your sipless poison<br />
          All I want now is a stop of events<br /></p>

          <p>You asked to<br />
          You asked to be<br />
          You asked to be pure poetry<br /></p>

          <p>Don’t blame me for your luckless form<br />
          Stuck with a gut of rotted sea foam<br />
          Why haven’t you prepared for the sunlight snow<br />
          Time’s coming fast, it keeps wanting more<br /></p>

          <p>You have to<br />
          You have to be<br />
          You have to be pure jealousy<br />
          </p>
