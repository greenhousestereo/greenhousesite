          <p>Waiting, wanting something more
What will you use me for
So long then…
Sitting with my eight new friends
At this computer desk
Belong here
The autumn storm that tore these trees apart
It left no snow, just branches in the yard
Stuck for days
Can’t complain

I am much too deep in debt
To do what I do
Thank you to my humble school,
For years I thought I knew the future

The autumn storm that tore these trees apart
It left no snow, just branches in the yard
Stuck for days
Can’t complain

The autumn storm that tore these trees apart
It left no snow, just branches in the yard
Stuck for days
Can’t complain
The autumn storm that tore these trees apart
It left no snow, just branches in the yard
Stuck for days
Can’t complain</p>
